# Hangman Game in Java ðŸŽ¯

A simple console-based Hangman game built with Java. The program selects a random word from a text file (words.txt) and allows the user to guess the word letter by letter. This project helped me practice Java basics like file reading, loops, and arrays.

## Features
- Picks random word from a file
- User guesses one letter at a time
- Shows correct and wrong guesses
- Displays win or lose at the end

## How to Run
1. Open this project in IntelliJ
2. Make sure words.txt is in the src folder
3. Run the Main.java file

## What's Next
I'm still learning Java and plan to upgrade this game into a full application with levels, GUI, and score tracking.
